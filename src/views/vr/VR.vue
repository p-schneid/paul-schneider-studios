                <p>
                  Traumatic burns are incredibly painful. Recovery from a severe
                  burn is possibly worse. The healing process is long and
                  demanding. Burn survivors must follow a specific regiment of
                  physical and psychological therapy. They must manage their
                  pain. Patient education is imperative. We built Pyrus Burns to
                  explore how augmented reality can help educate burn patients.
                  Using the Microsoft HoloLens, we project realistic burn
                  holograms onto the patient's arm. These holograms are designed
                  to help the patient understand their own burn, and how it's
                  appearance and feel will progress over time. I managed the UI
                  and UX development on this project.

                <p>
                  The UI has a lot of responsibility. It may seem like a simple
                  tag along canvas, but it encapsulates a lot of functionality.
                  The UI behaves as a guide, directing the user what to do,
                  where to look, and how to interact with the system. It walks
                  the user through the application - from the initial setup,
                  through all the phases of a burn cycle. It plays back audio
                  clips. It interprets commands. And it strives to keep its
                  distance - close enough to be helpful, but far enough not to
                  interfere.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As UI developer, it was my responsibility to build and
                  maintain this layer. I coordinated communication between the
                  user and the system. I constructed the interface elements in
                  Unity. I designed the wireframe holograms in Blender. I
                  programmed the behavior of all these objects. Along the way, I
                  learned the best practices for UI in mixed reality.

                <p>
                  Overlaying the burn realistically onto the patient's arm was
                  our greatest development challenge. This was critical to our
                  success. The hologram must be convincing enough to suspend the
                  user's reality. We had to convince the user the burn was on
                  their arm. The position, rotation, and scale of the hologram
                  had to be perfect.
                </p>

                <p><b>Arm Tracking Prototype</b></p>

                <p>
                  Our arm tracking prototype was very ambitious. We used
                  <a href="https://github.com/qian256/HoloLensARToolKit"
                    >HoloLensARToolkit</a
                  >, a library that leverages the HoloLens’ cameras to detect QR
                  codes and calculate their position and orientation in space.
                  We attached these QR codes onto a wristband, and strapped it
                  to the arm.
                </p>

                <div class="image narrow">
                  <img
                    class="img-responsive blue-border"
                    src="@/assets/qr-cube.jpg"
                  />
                </div>

                <p>
                  Finding the offset vector between the QR cube and arm was
                  difficult. After a few failed attempts, we came up with this
                  procedure:
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>The user attaches the cube to their wrist.</li>
                  <li>
                    The user calibrates the cube. We now know the cube's
                    location in every frame.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We project a wireframe arm hologram in front of the user.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The user places their arm inside the hologram. We now know
                    the arm's location in the current frame.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  At this exact point in time, we know the exact location of
                  both the cube and arm in space. We simply subtract one
                  position from the other, and we have our vector.
                </p>

                  </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                  Sadly, tracking wasn't consistent enough to suspend belief.
                  For ARToolkit to accurately track the QR codes, they must be
                  clearly visible in every frame. If they leave the viewing
                  frustum for even a second, tracking is disrupted, and the
                  illusion lost. This limitation is compounded by the HoloLens'
                  small FOV. To fit both the cube and hologram into the field of
                  view, the user had to look down their out-stretched arm. This
                  was very uncomfortable. Too much visual noise in the
                  background would also disrupt the tracking. Ultimately, this
                  prototype was too uncomfortable and too inconsistent.
                </p>

                <p><b>Static Prototype</b></p>

                <p>
                  We then pivoted to a simpler approach. Unable to reliably
                  track the arm through space, we had to restrict the arm to a
                  single point in space. We asked the user to place their arm in
                  a wireframe hologram located comfortably at their side. We
                  then projected the burn holograms on top. As long as the user
                  held this pose, our illusion was convincing. Though more
                  physically restrictive, the added comfort and persistence won
                  out.

                  This project was the culmination of a virtual reality course I
                  took in college. This was my very first exposure to VR. My
                  team built a parachute simulation from inexpensive consumer
                  products. This virtual reality system featured motion
                  tracking, head tracking, stereoscopic rendering, and a 3D
                  haptic display.

                  the analog rumble feature on the PS Move controllers. And I

                <p><b>Head Tilt Control</b></p>

                <p>
                  At Pyrus, we were exploring an XR solution for a certain
                  medical procedure. Without going into too much detail, this
                  procedure required both of the doctor's hands at all times. I
                  was tasked with developing a hands-free solution for rotating
                  anatomical models in virtual space.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Too meet this challenge, I came up with a head tilt mechanism.
                  It’s pretty simple. The physician's head acts as a joystick.
                  Our hardware can detect very fine head movements, similar to
                  what you might find on a console joystick. This control
                  mechanism is quite intuitive; because the head can pitch and
                  roll and turn, these rotations translate quite nicely when
                  rotating a 3D model. I developed the following prototype as a
                  proof-of-concept. Originally developed for Unity + HoloLens, I
                  recreated it in A-Frame to share here. Put on an HMD and check
                  it out!
